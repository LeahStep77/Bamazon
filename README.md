# Bamazon
Overview:
Bamazon is an interactive node app where products are stored in a MySQL table named products, which is stored in the database named bamazon_db.  On running the app, the user places an order by selecting item id and quantity, at which point the program checks stock for the item ordered.  If the item is out of stock, the program returns a note stating same.  If the item is in stock, the order total is calculated and displayed while the quantity is removed from the table.  If the user enters any character other than a number they will get a response asking the user to try again.
